## Available to Download!

## Details
Many components are slimmed down, so it can start faster and use less memory.

You can choose which version of Light you want by:
- **Hardware type:** I have x86 (32-bit) and x64 (64-bit) versions of Light available
- **Theme:** Currently, I offer Classic Firefox and Australis.
- **Compilation:** Light was built using both Virtual C++ (VC) and the Intel C++ Compiler (ICC); you can choose which one works better for you. VC builds require Intel or AMD CPUs that support SSE2, while ICC builds require Intel CPUs that support SSE4.1. Light may not run well on systems with AMD CPUs, so please report problems if you attempt to run it on such a system.
- **Language:** Currently, only English (eng) and Chinese (zh-CN) are available. Leave a comment if you need me to build it in another language.

*Note:* All builds support portable mode. In order to switch to it, please rename `custom_t.ini` to `custom.ini`.
